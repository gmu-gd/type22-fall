excerpt: Posters are traditionally a static medium but with more and more poster displays going digital and AR becoming a more widely available tool, posters can come alive.

### Description
Design a moving poster for a real, future event that preferably is happening on campus or around campus. The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message.
The final poster will be printed and we will use the [Artivive](https://artivive.com/) app to help with the AR version.

#### Requirements
* Each poster moves for the amount of time it needs to move
* Information for the event is clearly displayed
* Portrait format at 1080x1920 pixels
* Loops seamlessly
* Printed version at 15" x 26 2/3"
* AR version using Artivive

### Checkpoints
* January 27: Start & event selected
* February 3: Two different rough draft directions
* February 10: Still digital draft with brief storyboard for motion
* February 17: Refined poster with motion
* February 24: Final motion draft
* March 3: Printed poster with AR due
