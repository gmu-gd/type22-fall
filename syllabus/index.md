### Course Description
Provides a focused studio experience to conceptualize and design multiple applications for contemporary package design

### Overview
This is an advanced design course that will focus on 2-d and 3-d design concepts and production. Students will learn the techniques, concepts, and processes essential to understanding how to create and execute a packaging project, from ideation to final product.

Students will participate in all aspects of the development, design, assembly and presentation of package design projects. This will include concept development, research, writing, production, and presentation.

### Objectives
* Refine visual design skills on 3-d containers
* Build 3-d design skills from concept to physical form
* Develop craft skill including cutting, folding, gluing, taping
* Learn and demonstrate proficiency in 3-d prototyping tools such as 3-d printers and laser cutters
* Develop a project based on exploration, process, and iteration
* Exercise good time management skills
* Build skills when working within a group

### Required Materials

* Extra Blades
* Cutting Mat (12x18 minimum)
* Metal, cork backed ruler (18 inches minimum)
* Scissors
* Glue stick
* Tacky Glue (Aleene’s, Sobo)
* Clear Tape
* Masking Tape

### As Needed Materials

* Paper
* Wood
* Arylic

### Required Software
* Adobe CC

### Content
This class consists of  shorter exercises, in-class demos and workshops, and longer projects. The exercises, demos, and workshops are meant to build skills and learn new concepts and the projects are a place to demonstrate your understanding and ability to combine those skills and concepts.
projects

#### project 1: starter pack
Create a starter kit that has, what you considered, the three most important items for a graphic designer. You can choose any items, but they must be able to fit into a package that you can design and build. You will also create a name and a visual identity for your package.
#### project 2: form + function
You and a partner will work on a sustainable package design together with the goals of minimizing the materials used for the packaging, minimizing the waste created by the production process, and designing a container that can be reused in some way that is relevant to the item it is containing. You will also create a visual identity and design for the packaging.

### Discussion of Work
You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.

### Communication
Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. 
A simple, short email will be fine.

The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.

### Attendance
There is no specific attendance grade for this class, it is tied together with your engagement grade outlined below. However, if you miss four or more classes you will automatically fail the class unless you have communicated with me prior to the fourth absence.

### Engagement
This course has an engagement policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work). You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.

* Attend class meetings
* Create things and be prepared to show them on time.
* Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.
* Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.
* Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.
* Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.
* Care about yourself & your work, your classmates & their work, and this class.

### Grading
Grades will be based  on engagement (25%), exercises (25%), and projects (50%).

#### engagement (25%)
This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on above. Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.

#### exercises (25%)
The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and design knowledge.

#### projects (50%)
Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your week to week process and the second grade will be based on the final submission. At the end of the semester you will have 4 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 50%.

### Late Work
Late work will be accepted for three weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project which will be due at the end of the semester. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade. 

### Rubrics
Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are on the last pages of the syllabus and tied to each submission on Blackboard. The rubrics are here to allow you to understand how work is graded and to reference while working to self-evaluate.

### Weekly Schedule
Class is on Tuesdays from 1:30–4:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Some classes will be work days so make sure to bring things to work on each class. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.

A note—Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.

### Semester Schedule
The [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this spring. It is subject to additions and subtractions.

### Open Studio
The design faculty will be hosting open studio hours in room 1023. When the open studio is open, you will have access to computers, a space to work, or get feedback and help from the faculty member in the room. The schedule will be posted on the door of 1023 and online at [art.gmu.edu/open-studio](art.gmu.edu/open-studio).

### Commitment to Diversity
This class will be conducted as an intentionally inclusive community that celebrates diversity and welcomes the participation in the life of the university of faculty, staff and students who reflect the diversity of our plural society. All may feel free to speak and to be heard without fear that the content of the opinions they express will bias the evaluation of their academic performance or hinder their opportunities for participation in class activities. In turn, all are expected to be respectful of each other without regard to race, class, linguistic background, religion, political beliefs, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, veteran’s status, or physical ability.

### Land Acknowledgment
At the place George Mason University occupies, we give greetings and thanksgivings to these Potomac River life sources, the Doeg ancestors, who Virginia annihilated in violent campaigns while ripping their lands apart with the brutal system of African American enslavement, to the recognized Virginia tribes who have lovingly stewarded these lands for millennia including the Rappahannock, Pamunkey, Upper Mattaponi, Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Nansemond, Monacan, Mattaponi, Patawomeck, and Nottaway, past, present, and future, and to the Piscataway tribes, who have lived on both sides of the river from time immemorial. 

### Anti-racism Statement
The School of Art plays an integral role in building an educational environment that is committed to anti-racism and inclusive excellence. An anti-racist approach to higher education acknowledges the ways that individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural manifestations of racism against Black, Indigenous, and other people of color contribute to inequality and injustice in our classrooms, on our campuses, and in our communities.  It strives to provide our community members with resources to interrupt cycles of racism so as to cultivate a more equitable, inclusive, and just environment for all of our students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends, regardless of racial background. An anti-racism approach is an active and ongoing, long-term process. In all our efforts, we uphold a commitment to creating honest, respectful, supportive, 
and healing spaces where members of our community can meaningfully dialogue and learn from each other’s lived experiences for the betterment of our entire community.

### Attendance Policies
Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of non-participation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor’s grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.

### Students with Disabilities and Learning Differences
Students with disabilities who seek accommodations in a course must be registered with the George Mason University Office of Disability Services (ODS) and inform their instructor, in writing, at the beginning of the semester [http://ods.gmu.edu](http://ods.gmu.edu)

### Official Communications via Mason E-mail
Students are responsible for the content of university communications sent 
to their George Mason University e-mail account and are required to activate their account and check it regularly. All communication from the university, college, school, and program will be sent to students solely through their Mason e-mail account.

### Writing Center and Library Resources
Students who need intensive help with grammar, structure or mechanics in their writing should make use of the services of Writing Center. The Writing Center is holding all sessions online, with writers choosing between meeting their tutor in real time on Zoom or uploading a draft for their tutor’s written feedback. Please send your questions to wcenter@gmu.edu

Provisions Research Center for Art & Social Change is in Room L001 of the Art & Design Building.

### Important Deadlines
Once the add and drop deadlines have passed, instructors do not have the authority to approve requests from students to add or drop/withdraw late. Requests for late adds (up until the last day of classes) must be made by the student in the School of Art office (or the office of the department offering the course), and generally are only approved in the case of a documented university error (such as a problem with financial aid being processed), LATE ADD fee will apply. Requests for non-selective withdrawals and retroactive adds (adds after the last day of classes) must be approved by the academic dean of the college in which the student’s major is located. For AVT majors, that is the CVPA Office of Academic Affairs in College Hall.
