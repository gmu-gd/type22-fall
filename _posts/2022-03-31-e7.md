#### Exercise 7: Logo Reveal
Make a short video that animates an existing, relatively well-known logo. The video should use one of the strategies we covered in class. For example, you could pick the Target logo and your video would somehow emphasize that the logo is a target. The choice of logo is up to you but the colors, logo, and type should all remain the same (look for an eps or svg file for the logo). You are not redesigning anything.

A reference board you can look and or add to if you want is on [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_khOuqi0=/).
